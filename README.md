Module 10 Challenge is about exploring Hawaii Climate database provided utilising Python and SQLAlchemy.

## Part 1: Analysis and Exploration of the Climate Data 
In this section, I will be using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, I will use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

The Code to run it in is climate_starter.ipynb 

## Part 2: app.py 
Now that I have completed my initial analysis, I will design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.
